        <h3><u>Visualization Summary</u></h3>
        <p>The focus of this visualization is to guide the user through the financial considerations when evaluating a
        college in California.  In general, a large consideration for most prospective students is the earning potential
        after graduating college.  In today's society, it is a large investment by the student to embark on a journey through
        college.  For this reason, I chose to use an interactive slide show to illustrate the financial considerations that
        potential students must consider when evaluating a college.  It does a comparision of median incomes against other
        common financial considerations such as the % of students using loans, average net spend per year, and the mean debt of
        students after graduating college.</p>

        <p>Each slide in the presentation represents a different financial aspect of the cost of college, as it relates
            to the earned income of graduating students; to allow the user to focus on that particular aspect of cost of college.
            I've chosen to allow the user to have the freedom to "bounce" between scenes, as to allow the user to easily compare schools
            for different factors.  No cost aspect is more weighted then the other, as the objective is to allow the user to evaluate schools
            and draw their own conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scatter plot visualization was the best visualization suited for this message, as it clearly showed the relationships
            between median earned income and the other cost factors when attending different universities.  It allowed the users to easily identify
            the colleges that have high earning potential, and would incur the smallest amount of potential costs, by showing where colleges
            clustered in the visualization.

            I enabled tooltips to allow users the ability to get more detailed information about the individual school, and inform the user
            about this school.  The major intent of this visualization was geared specifically to prospective students who
            are considering the California University system for their studies, and seeing which school met their financial objectives.

        <h3><u>Scene: Average Net Costs</u></h3>
        <p>The focus of this scene was to take the Average Net Costs, and compare this information against the median earned
        income of studens post-college.  The Average Net Costs represents the calculated data based on calculations by the each
        University cost calculator, which took into consideration annual college costs such as tuition, room & board, books,
        transportation, food, and subtracted any potential scholarships and grants to arrived at the annual net costs of
        attendance.

        <h3><u>Scene: College Debt</u></h3>
        <p>This scene was meant to capture the mean debt that students accumulated post graduation.  In concert with the other
        scenes, it allows the user to answer the question, of which college by numbers represents the best value for long
        term earning potential.</p>

        <h3><u>Scene: Federal Loan</u></h3>
        <p>This scene was meant to paint a picture of student that leveraged a federal loan to finance their college education.
        Though the percentage of students using a federal loan doesn't quite convey the gravity of financial burden, it does imply
        the indication of financial assistance needed to fund an education at the school.  Hence, in considering this along with
        the median earned income, it shows the likelihood of paying off a federal loan.</p>

        <h3><u>Parameters, Triggers, and Events</u></h3>
        <p>The parameter used across all scenes is the median income across the California University System. I leveraged a sliding bar
        to filter based on median income.  This sliding bar acted as a filter to trigger an update on the visualization to show
        the filtered view.  For each time the sliding bar filter is adjusted, it will update the visualization.  To enable users,
        to get a more detailed view of the scatter plot, I enabled tips on the hover of individual plotted dots to expose the
        full detail information of the school, such as the school name, and exact amounts for median income, average net costs, mean
            debt, and % of federal loan for each scene.</p>

        <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
        <p>As a summarized conclusion to this essay, a large portion of the public university tend to present high value in terms
        of lower debt, average net costs, and federal against higher median incomes.  In regards to observations, Stanford University
        represented the best value in terms of the lowest costs considerations against median earned incomes for graduates from there.
        This is in part due to the reputation of Stanford and it's ability to attract highly qualified academic candidates.
        The lower costs is likely due to it's availability and opportunity for students to qualify for a broad spectrum of
            scholarships and grants.</p>
